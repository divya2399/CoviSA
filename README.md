### How to make this work :
 - Add the api's and key's as mentioned in the code comments.
 - Install the node and python dependencies.
 -The react build has been ejected to work according to a flask server.

 - Move to the covisa-react directory and use the commands :

 ```
 yarn build
```
Followed By:

```
yarn start-api
```
This would serve the React App over a Flask Server.
